Binary Relations
= (the equals sign ) means “is the same as” and was ﬁrst introduced in the 1557 book The
Whetstone of Witte by Robert Recorde (c. 1510-1558). He wrote, ”I will sette as I doe often
in woorke use, a paire of parralles, or Gemowe lines of one lengthe, thus : ==, bicause noe 2,
thynges, can be moare equalle.” (Recorde used an elongated form of the modern equals sign.)
<(theless than sign ) mean “is strictly less than”, and >(thegreater than sign ) means
“is strictly greater than”. They ﬁrst appeared in Artis Analyticae Praxis ad Aequationes
Algebraicas Resolvendas (“The Analytical Arts Applied to Solving Algebraic Equations”) by
Thomas Harriot (1560-1621), which was published posthumously in 1631.
Pierre Bouguer (1698-1758) later reﬁned these to ≤(“less than or equals”) and ≥(“greater
than or equals”) in 1734.
:= (the equal by deﬁnition sign ) means “is equal by deﬁnition to”. This is a common alternate
form of the symbol “= Def”, which appears in the 1894 book Logica Matematica by the logician
Cesare Burali-Forti (1861–1931). Other common alternate forms of the symbol “= Def” include
“def= ” and “ ≡”, the latter being especially common in applied mathematics.
Some Symbols from Mathematical Logic
∴(three dots ) means “therefore” and ﬁrst appeared in print in the 1659 book Teusche Algebra
(“Teach Yourself Algebra”) by Johann Rahn (1622-1676).
/owner(thesuch that sign) means “under the condition that”. However, it is much more common
(and less ambiguous) to just abbreviate “such that” as “s.t.”.
⇒(theimplies sign) means “logically implies that”. (E.g., “if it’s raining, then it’s pouring” is
equivalent to saying “it’s raining ⇒it’s pouring.”)
The history of this symbol is unclear.
⇐⇒ (theiﬀsign) means “if and only if” and is used to connect logically equivalent statements.
(E.g., “it’s raining iﬀ it’s really humid” means simultaneously that “if it’s raining, then it’s
